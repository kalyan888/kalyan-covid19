      <p className="question">
        What are your sources? How is the data gathered for this project?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        The vaccines must be proven safe and effective in large (phase III)
        clinical trials. Some COVID-19 vaccine candidates have completed their
        phase III trials, and many other potential vaccines are being developed.
        Independent reviews of the efficacy and safety evidence is required for
        each vaccine candidate, including regulatory review and approval in the
        country where the vaccine is manufactured, before WHO considers a
        vaccine candidate for prequalification.

      <p className="question">
        Why does covid19india.org have difference in numbers compared to MOHFW
        website?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        The vaccines must be manufactured in large quantities, which is a major
        and unprecedented challenge â€“ all the while continuing to produce all
        the other important life-saving vaccines already in use. As a final
        step, all approved vaccines will require distribution through a complex
        logistical process, with rigorous stock management and temperature
        control.

      <p className="question">Where can I find the data for this? website?</p>
      <p className="answer">
        In addition to review of the data for regulatory purposes, the evidence
        must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how
        the vaccines should be used.

      <p className="question">
        Why are you guys putting in time and resources to do this while not
        gaining a single penny from it?
      </p>
      <p className="answer">
        In addition to review of the data for regulatory purposes, the evidence
        must also be reviewed for the purpose of policy recommendations on how
        the vaccines should be used. , Officials in individual countries decide
        whether to approve the vaccines for national use and develop policies
        for how to use the vaccines in their country based on the WHO
        recommendations.
